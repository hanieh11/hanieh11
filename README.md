Hello there. I'm Hanieh, AI engineer and researcher by day, art enthusiast by night and adventurer at heart.
My research and work interest are:

1. **Computational Cognitive Neuroscience**: I am interested in the intersection of cognitive processes, human learning, and artificial intelligence, particularly how insights from neuroscience can inform AI development.
2. **Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning**: I have a strong focus on advanced machine learning techniques, specifically in developing and improving deep learning models and reinforcement learning algorithms. My work includes using unsupervised methods and contrastive learning to enhance learning efficiency, akin to human cognitive processes.
3. **Data-Driven Affect Prediction**: I am keen on exploring data-driven approaches for understanding and predicting human emotions based on behavior, possibly linking this to my interest in affective computing and human-centered AI.
4. **Pattern Recognition and Signal Processing**: My background includes working with distributed antenna systems (DAS) signals and performing pattern recognition tasks, showing an interest in the analysis and interpretation of complex data.
5. **Interdisciplinary Approaches**: I enjoy integrating different fields, such as neuroscience, AI, and cognitive sciences, and I am interested in collaborative projects that involve diverse methodologies, such as machine learning, computer vision, and bioinformatics.
6. **Practical Applications in Real-World Settings**: I am focused on developing algorithms that are data-efficient and applicable in real-world scenarios, such as healthcare and education, where understanding human emotions is crucial.
7. **Research and Development (R&D)**: I am passionate about R&D and enjoy the process of exploring new ideas, replicating results from state-of-the-art papers, and finding ways to improve existing models and algorithms.
